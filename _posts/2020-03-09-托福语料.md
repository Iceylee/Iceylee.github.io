## working from home （103）
I prefer to work at home, there are two reasons。

Firstly,  working at home makes me more productive. As a programmer , my work requires a strong attention to detail and long hours of focus. When I am sitting in an office, there are so many potential distractions, with consumers knocking on the door and collegues making phone calls. Instead, while working alone at home, I can concentrate on my scripts,so I can accomplish more work.

Also working at home will save plenty of time for people who live far away from work. My company is 10 kilometers away , if I work at home, at least one hour will saved ,thus I can spend more time with my family ,or subscribe one course on coursera to make myself more skillful.



To be specific，working at home can save the commuting time, and also the transportation fees.

## Ebook(96)

I prefer to read ebooks.
Firstly, ebooks take up less space. In fact, you don't need any space to store them. As a heavy reader myself, I store hundreds of ebooks on my computer  and kindle, without buying new bookshelves.

Secondly,it 's very convient to read ebooks.It is like carrying a library abround in your pocket. To be specific, I usually read books on kindel, I can read anytime and anywhere I want. For example, I like to read in my commuting time and while I am waiting in line.




you can read ebooks everywhere, on the bus, train, airplane, and while standing in line.

You can carry with you a great number of ebooks wherever you go, which you cannot do with ordinary books.

 Ebooks are portable. You can carry a whole library of hundreds of books with you, on CD, in a laptop, notebook or any ebook reader, without worrying about their weight.

## eating habit( without phone)
I think we should eat our meals without phones.

Firstly, you will pay more attention to your company at table without a phone. For example, dinner time is the only time of the day I have to get together as family. We sit at the table ,eat and talk about random things,I think it's the real family bonding moment.

Secondly, Eating distractedly may be bad for our health. To be specific, swallowing pieces of food that haven’t been chewed up properly, can be a choking hazard and can also lead to indigestion and even an upset stomach.


More of our time now is occupied by gadgets?, dinner time is probably the only time of the day we have to get together as family.Cook up a new meal,sit at the table ,eat and talk about random things,I think it's the real family bonding moment.

It's bad for your digestive system.
Whenever you eat, try to put down your phones,ipads,labtopsand just enjoy the food with your company.
mute phone, say excuse me and then walk away to answer the phone call. 
On a business lunch , it's considered rude and disrespectful

I live in a five-person household , me and my husband, our kid,and my parents.

weekend rituals
We just order in, put on a movie and eat our meanls by the bed or on the couch. It's relaxing.
As students who are too busy with their school work, they probably ddon't have the luxury to sit down at the table.

How much time do you spend in a day, seated with your family while really interacting with them? Think about it.

In most modern day families, the answer would be ‘not much’.

Making mealtime a collective activity that your family is engaged in teaches your child the importance of keeping in touch with family and can give you details about your children’s lives and interests as they’re growing up.

This directly helps in strengthening the bond you have with them.


 
##  big company or small (96)
I choose to work in the big company.

Firstly, it's more likely to meet experienced people who have made landmark contributions. For example, as a programer, I'm thrilled to meet a legend who wrote the algorithm I just learned from github. 

Secondly, large companies have structured training programs. To be specific, I can be access to programs in technology skills, business processes, Human resource management, and Intellectual property etc. In that way, I will be trained on diverse skills that are beneficial to my career.


As with starting any new job, or new position within a company there is sure to be a **learning curve**. Therefore, having experienced mentors allows for getting up to speed and feeling like a valuable, contributing player quicker thus being able to take well-informed action. This is yet another benefit of working for a big corporation. 

meet experienced smart people who have made landmark contributions in developing the state-of-the-art

You have time to reflect. At a small company or startup, it can often feel that you squeeze a lifetime into every single day. Large companies do not move at such a reckless pace so you have time to learn and reflect.

I learn more while working in big companies.They are some of the most resourceful people you will ever meet, combining great technical skills with the ability to manage on no budget and great political acumen.


You get access to expensive equipment and tools and practical experience working on them. 

## Discussion 
I prefer to be graded by participating in the discussion class coz I believe in the values of discussion.

First of all, we can learn from others in discussion classes. To to more specific, as my classmates directly share their opinions, thoughts, and questions about course content, I’m able to consider various viewpoints on a topic.

Secondly, discussions allow students to explore a topic more deeply than simply reading about it or listening to a lecture about the topic. For example, through discussing the book Hamlet in my literature class, I explored many small aspects and details that were ignored when I listened to the lecture.

##one apartment is near the campus but slightly expensive
- time 
- money offset commuting 

I prefer the apartment nearby.

First of all, living near campus will give me easy access to my school’s many resources, such as the library. By living close, I can sometimes just walk to school or to the library to study. 

Secondly, apartment nearby means less time on commute, more time for self-development. Time is the most valuable thing, not money, I can use this time to be more productive. (coursera)



**The faster commute will save me precious time that is better spent on family bonding. **

**Getting to class on time is key to your success as a student**, **even more so** when you’re a freshman. Not to mention the fact that coming to class late, causing every eye to look your way is embarrassing.

Any event held on campus can draw visitors from all around. By living close to campus, you can quickly and easily get to these fun activities **without fighting traffic**. Whether it is a football game or listening to a famous lecturer, or speaker, living close will give you quicker and easier access to anything and everything going on at school.

## apartment & dorm
1. Privacy

Yes, your dorm room has a door to shut away the prying eyes of neighbors, but that’s about the extent of privacy you’ll enjoy. More than likely, you’ll have to share your dorm room with a complete stranger. This gives you an opportunity to make a new friend, but in the beginning it can be a bit uncomfortable.

Even more potentially embarrassing is the shared bathroom situation. Most dorms have shared toilets and showers, which means you could be doing all of your business with an audience, so to speak. You won’t have this problem with an apartment.

2. Freedom

There’s no getting around the fact that dorms have rules. Although rules and regulations may vary by campus and even by building, it’s not uncommon to deal with curfews, gender restrictions, and of course, bans on alcohol. You will probably also have to put up with inspections and meetings with your RA or dorm advisor.

This isn’t to say you won’t have any rules when you rent an apartment and sign a lease. You obviously can’t cause property damage or disturb neighbors with raging parties at all hours of the night – common sense stuff. However, you will have a lot more freedom when it comes to the hours you keep, the guests you have, and your lifestyle in general.

good angle to elabrate：
I prefer a far but cheaper apartment.

• First of all, I’m more comfortable with more cash at hand which might help me achieve positive goals. For example, I’ve always wanted to take an art class or go on a vacation in another country. With the money I saved from my apartment, I have the opportunity to see the world in different ways.

• Secondly, distance is not a problem for me coz I’m a morning person so I’m not worried about being late for school. To be specific, I wake up at 6 am every morning and arrive at my classroom at around 7 while the first classes start at eight.

## educational benefits
Globalization and international trade require countries and their economies to compete with each other. Economically successful countries will hold competitive and comparative advantages over other economies,
The education and training of a country's workforce is a major factor in determining how well the country's economy will perform.

## save green space
I disagree with this proposal.

First of all, citizens just need a place to simply go and relax.

This last green space represents a haven of peace-and-quiet for us, away from the daily stress of school as well as a break from the concrete jungle. To sit on a bench and watch people, or just walk around enjoying nature is just a part of city life.

Besides, the vast number of trees and grass growing in this space help improve air quality in the city. 

To be more specific, they **absorb exhaust fumes** emitted by cars and factories so that we could breathe fresh air everyday.

## International food fair /music festival /film festival
I think an international music festival is the best.

• First of all, it’s a great opportunity for students to unwind a little bit. **My piled up daily stress at school and home always makes me feel down and sometimes alone.**  It’s nice to join a music festival and burst a pack of fun and sing my favorite song in the crowd as loud as I can.

• Also, music is the international language that we all speak even if we come from completely different countries. For example, Mozart speaks to the whole world through his music. I’m sure international and local students would both find a sense of identity and belonging.

## tv positive on society

It's a good source of information. We all like watching international news, in that way we are up-to-date with breaking news around the world. My son likes watching educational programs , I think they increase his knowledge and make him more aware of the world around us.
 
Besides, Gathering around the television gives families, friends, watching the games with your family might bring you closer together; reminiscing about shows you've watched together gives you shared history and memories.

## send text messages or make phone calls 
-interr 
-

I prefer sending text messges.

Firstly, I don't want to interrupt my contact. To to specific, calls often take people's attention away, and that's even worse when they are  
in a meeting, teaching a class, or typing up a report.

Secondly, texting can avoid disturbing people around myself. I share an office with 20 people, my voice would distract others from their work. 

Unlike making a phone call, texting can be carried out in relative privacy. Whether you are in a busy office, at the cinema, or sat on a train, it's easy to send and receive texts without disrupting those around you, and what you read and write is not made public.


Text if you think your contact might be indisposed. Calls take your attention away from what you’re doing. A text message, on the other hand, can wait until you finish your work. If you think your contact might be in a meeting, teaching a class, or typing up a report, send a text.[8] Give them a few hours to reply before retexting.

Text to avoid disturbing those around you. Maybe you share an office with several other people. Maybe you live with a third-shift worker who sleeps during your waking hours. Situations like these call for courtesy. If your voice will distract others from their work or wake someone who is sleeping, opt to send a text message—and set your phone to vibrate for the reply.[9]
